= rTar

NOTE: This project has been dicontinued. See IMPORTANT notice below.

== OVERVIEW

rTar is a package format based on tar. But it follows a structural pattern
of recursion to allow efficent cherry picking of data from within an archive.

The idea is as follows. Given a directory structure:

  foo/
    f.txt
    g/
      a.txt
      b.txt
    h/
      c.txt
      d.txt
  
The archive would work from the bottom up, transition to...

  a/
    f.txt
    g/
      a.txt.gz
      b.txt.gz
    h/
      c.txt.gz
      d.txt.gz

Then...

  foo/
    f.txt.gz
    g.tar.gz
    h.tar.gz

And finally...

  foo.tar.gz

So at every level in the directory structure we have a new archive, and each
piece can be uncompresses separately without uncompress other parts and an 
equal level.

== IMPORTANT

rTar has never been fully developer becuase it was realizes that nearly the
same thing can be achieved using standard command line tools. For instance:

  $ gzip -r foo

Can recusively compress every file with the foo directory and it's subdirectory.
That's half way home to way rTar was seeking to do. The next step is a little
tricker, but it simply requires descending to the bottom of the directory and
tarballing every directory on the way up. I am not sure how to do this off hand
but I best a good shell coder could do it in a few lines of code --and the
decompressor would be just as effective.

So the bottom line is this. rTar could easily be written as a shell command
in a few dozen lines of code at most. Moreove the overall usefulness of this
library is probably pretty low. So the Ruby project has been dicontinued.
